NAME
    Apache::CookieToQuery - Rewrite query string by adding cookie
    information

SYNOPSIS
      In httpd.conf or similiar
 
      <Location /YourLocation>
            PerlAddVar IncludeCookie WSID
            PerlAddVar IncludeCookie SID
            PerlAddVar IncludeCookie QID
            PerlAddVar CookieAlias WSID:WebSiteId
            PerlAddVar CookieAlias QID:QueryId
            PerlFixupHandler Apache::CookieToQuery  
      </Location>

      Requests for http://yourhost/YourLocation?extra_params=12345

      Will now become rewritten so they look similiar to:

      http://yourhost/YourLocation?WebSiteId=<cookie WSID>;SID=<cookie SID>;QueryId=<cookie QID>;extra_params=12345

      Where <cookie WSID> for example is the value of cookie named WSID

DESCRIPTION
     This module will aid in adding cookie information to your query strings
     so that cgi scripts or handlers underneath can have immidate benefit

     It requires mod_perl + Apache web server with PERL_FIXUP callback hook enabled
     for more information on callback hooks refer to: 
     http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html#Callback_Hooks

     IncludeCookie specifies cookie names that will be added, if none are specified
     any cookie name is taken into consideration

     CookieAlias specifies cookie name to look for and cookie name to alias it with 
     when query string is rewritten, if alias for a cookie name does not exist, 
     original cookie name will be used 

     Please note that in the current implementation cookies always take precedence 
     over query string paramaters 

     This package should always be installed as PerlFixupHandler so that it can execute before
     standard PerlResponseHandler is called
