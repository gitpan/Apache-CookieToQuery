     This module will aid in adding cookie information to your query strings
     so that cgi scripts or handlers underneath can have immidate benefit

     It requires mod_perl + Apache web server with PERL_FIXUP callback hook enabled
     for more information refer on callback hooks refer to: 
     http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html#Callback_Hooks

     IncludeCookie specifies cookie names that will be added, if none are specified
     any cookie name is taken into consideration

     CookieAlias specifies cookie name to look for and cookie name to alias it with 
     when query string is rewritten, if alias for a cookie name does not exist, 
     original cookie name will be used 

     Please note that in the current implementation cookies always take precedence 
     over query string paramaters
